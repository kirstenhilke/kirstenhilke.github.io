Introduction

The first project from the Odin Project's curriculum is a mini-project to learn basic practical skills in programming. The goal of the mini-project is to deconstruct the Google homepage and rebuild it, but simplified. Required for the mini-project is to imitate the basic structure, elements, style and alignment of the Google homepage, but without its functionality in detail.
